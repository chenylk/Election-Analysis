# Election-Analysis
Analyzing Election Data With Python

## Project Overview
 * Raw data of the votes for the Colorado board of elections was analyzed to determine the winning candidate and the county with the largest turnout. 

## Results
 * There were a total of 369711 votes casted in the Colorado board of elections.
 * There were 3 counties where votes were counted:
    1. Jefferson (38,855 Votes) 10.5%
    2. Denver (306,055 Votes) 82.8%
    3. Arapahoe (24,801 Votes) 6.7%
 * Denver county had the largest number of votes
 * There were 3 candidates who were running for office:
    1. Charles Casper Stockham (852,313 Votes) 23.0%
    2. Diana Degette (272,892 Votes) 73.8%
    3. Raymon Anthony Doane (11,606) 3.1%
 * Diana Degette won the election with 272,892 votes which was 73.8% of the total votes.

## Summary
 * This code could be reused for other elections around the country. Some modifications that would need to be done on case by case basis. Some raw election data may not come in csv format. In this case, we would need to find a different python package to analyze the code. However, the base of the code would be similar in creating lists of the candidates and counties. The winning candidate and highest turnout county could still be calculated after converting the data file correctly. If this code were to be used for a national election, the data would still be sorted with the code correctly. The names of the lists would need to change depending on what level of territory is analyzed.
